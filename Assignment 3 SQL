FROM Customers c LEFT JOIN Employees e ON c.City = e.City
WHERE e.City IS NULL

--3. List all products and their total order quantities throughout all orders.
SELECT p.ProductID, p.ProductName,
(SELECT SUM(od.Quantity) FROM [Order Details] od WHERE p.ProductID = od.ProductID) TotalOrderQuantities
FROM Products p

--4. List all Customer Cities and total products ordered by that city.
SELECT c.City, COUNT(DISTINCT od.ProductID) AS TotalProductsOrdered
FROM Customers c LEFT JOIN Orders o ON c.CustomerID = o.CustomerID JOIN [Order Details] od ON o.OrderID = od.OrderID JOIN Products p ON od.ProductID = p.ProductID
GROUP BY c.City

--5. List all Customer Cities that have at least two customers.
--   a. Use union
--   b. Use sub-query and no union
SELECT City, COUNT(City) AS NumCustomers
FROM Customers
GROUP BY City
HAVING COUNT(City) > 1

--6. List all Customer Cities that have ordered at least two different kinds of products.
SELECT c.City
FROM Customers c JOIN Orders o ON c.CustomerID = o.CustomerID JOIN [Order Details] od ON o.OrderID = od.OrderID
GROUP BY c.City

--7. List all Customers who have ordered products, but have the ‘ship city’ on the order different from their own customer cities.

FROM Customers c JOIN Orders o ON c.CustomerID = o.CustomerID
WHERE c.City != o.ShipCity

--8. List 5 most popular products, their average price, and the customer city that ordered most quantity of it.
SELECT TOP 5 p.ProductID, p.ProductName, AVG(od.UnitPrice) AS AvgPrice, c.City
FROM Orders o JOIN [Order Details] od ON o.OrderID = od.OrderID JOIN Products p ON od.ProductID = p.ProductID JOIN Customers c ON o.CustomerID = c.CustomerID
GROUP BY p.ProductID, p.ProductName, c.City
ORDER BY COUNT(od.ProductID) DESC

--9. List all cities that have never ordered something but we have employees there.
--   a. Use sub-query
SELECT City
FROM Customers

--   b. Do not use sub-query
SELECT *
FROM Customers c LEFT JOIN Orders o ON c.City = o.ShipCity
WHERE o.ShipCity IS NULL

--10. List one city, if exists, that is the city from where the employee sold most orders (not the product quantity) is, and also the city of most total quantity of products ordered from. (tip: join  sub-query)
SELECT TOP 1 ShipCity, COUNT(DISTINCT EmployeeID) AS NumEmployees, SUM(od.Quantity) AS TotalQuantity
FROM Orders o JOIN [Order Details] od ON o.OrderID = od.OrderID JOIN Products p ON od.ProductID = p.ProductID
GROUP BY ShipCity
ORDER BY NumEmployees DESC, TotalQuantity DESC

--11. How do you remove the duplicates record of a table?
